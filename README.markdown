# Build monitor

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/pmlrigeep485pv0m?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ceddlyburge/buildmonitor)

Measures build times in Visual Studio.

This is a fork of the original, that adds the following:
- Support for Visual Studio 2019
- An IsRebuildAll flag
- A form showing the breakdown by month and solution (under `Tools - Show Solution Build Times`)
- An option to choose the location of the json file where the results are saved

## To install

Clone this repo, build, and then double click on the vsix in `BuildMonitorPackage\bin\Release` (or debug output folder).

## How it works

When any solution is opened, the extension is loaded and will start output to a output-window called "Build monitor" 
(Found in View -> Output -> Change "Show output from:" dropdown-list). 

It measures solution total build time and each project built. 

After every build the data is also saved to a file on disk (see output-window for path) as json.
